# Regex Data Extraction & Validation

This project is a Python-based solution for validating various types of data using regular expressions (regex). It provides a collection of functions that validate email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, times, hashtags, currency amounts, and also extract HTML tags from a string of text. The goal is to streamline the process of validating and processing data efficiently using regex patterns.

## Project Overview

In today's data-driven world, validating and processing data is crucial for ensuring that the data meets certain quality and format standards. This project provides a simple yet effective approach to validate and process common types of data through regular expressions.

The project includes functions to:
- Validate email addresses
- Validate URLs
- Validate phone numbers
- Validate credit card numbers
- Validate time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats
- Extract HTML tags from a string
- Validate hashtags
- Validate currency amounts

## Features

- **Email Validation**: Validates email addresses using a regex pattern that supports common email formats.
- **URL Validation**: Validates URLs, checking for proper structure (http/https, domain, and optional paths).
- **Phone Number Validation**: Validates phone numbers with formats such as `(123) 456-7890`, `123-456-7890`, and `123.456.7890`.
- **Credit Card Validation**: Ensures the credit card number is in a valid format with possible hyphens or spaces separating groups of digits.
- **Time Validation**: Supports both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats and validates their correctness.
- **HTML Tag Extraction**: Extracts HTML tags and their content from a string using a regex pattern.
- **Hashtag Validation**: Ensures that hashtags only contain alphanumeric characters and start with the `#` symbol.
- **Currency Validation**: Validates currency amounts in the format `$1,234.56`, including optional commas for thousands.
